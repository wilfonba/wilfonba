## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I am a PhD student in computational science and engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Spencer Bryngelson
* I work on developing the GPU accelerated compressible multiphase flow solver [MFC](https://mflowcode.github.io) ([GitHub repo.](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC))
  * MFC is written in Fortran and GPU accelerated using OpenACC
  * MFC scales with near-ideal efficiency to over 65k processes on OLCF Frontier
  * MFC uses high-order spatial and temporal reconstructions for high-fidelity simulation
* I'm passionate about computational fluid dynamics, scientific visualization, and leadership class supercomputing
